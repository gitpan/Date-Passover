Date::Passover

Calculate the date of Passover or Rosh Hashanah for any year.

Based on algorithms found at
http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/BillInfo/ReligiousCalendars.html

use Date::Passover;

# In list context
($month, $day) = passover( 1996 );
($month, $day) = roshhashanah( 1998 );

# In scalar context returns a Date::ICal object
$date = passover( 1996 );
$date = roshhashanah( 1998 );

This package also contains Date::GoldenNumber, which calculates the
golden number for a given year. This is used in so many calendar
calculations that it is unlikely to remain in this package for very
long.
